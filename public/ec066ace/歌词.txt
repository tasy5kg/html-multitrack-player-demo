The Show - Lenka
Lyrics by：Lenka Kripac/Jason Reeves
Composed by：Lenka Kripac/Jason Reeves
Produced by：Stuart Brawley
I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
Life is a maze and love is a riddle
I don't know where to go can't do it alone I've tried
And I don't know why
Slow it down make it stop
Or else my heart is going to pop
'Cause it's too much yeah it's a lot
To be something I'm not
I'm a fool out of love
'Cause I just can't get enough
I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
Life is a maze and love is a riddle
I don't know where to go can't do it alone I've tried
And I don't know why
I am just a little girl lost in the moment
I'm so scared but I don't show it
I can't figure it out
It's bringing me down I know
I've got to let it go
And just enjoy the show
The sun is hot in the sky
Just like a giant spotlight
The people follow the sign
And synchronize in time
It's a joke nobody knows
They've got a ticket to that show
Yeah
I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
Life is a maze and love is a riddle
I don't know where to go can't do it alone I've tried
And I don't know why
I am just a little girl lost in the moment
I'm so scared but I don't show it
I can't figure it out
It's bringing me down I know
I've got to let it go
And just enjoy the show
Just enjoy the show
I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
Life is a maze and love is a riddle
I don't know where to go can't do it alone I've tried
And I don't know why
I am just a little girl lost in the moment
I'm so scared but I don't show it
I can't figure it out
It's bringing me down I know
I've got to let it go
And just enjoy the show
Dum de dum dudum de dum
Just enjoy the show
Dum de dum dudum de dum
Just enjoy the show
I want my money back
I want my money back
I want my money back
Just enjoy the show
I want my money back
I want my money back
I want my money back
Just enjoy the show
